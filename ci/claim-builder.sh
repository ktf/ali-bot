# A build loop that takes work by CLAIMING it, rather than by owning a hash
# shard of it. The claimed counterpart of continuous-builder.sh.
#
# continuous-builder.sh is deliberately left alone: it drives every production
# builder, and the two differ in ways that cannot be expressed as a flag --
# which PRs a worker considers, how it avoids duplicating another worker, and
# whether it re-execs itself. Running them side by side is also what lets a
# single pool be migrated at a time. See ci/SCALING_PLAN.md, Phases 1-3.
#
# What it does each round:
#   1. optionally source $ROUND_SETUP, for credentials that expire;
#   2. refresh the *.env files from ali-bot@master;
#   3. list every buildable PR, in the order the lister recommends;
#   4. walk that list and build the FIRST one it can claim;
#   5. sleep only if it built nothing.
#
# Because every worker asks for the whole list and claims decide who builds
# what, workers need no coordination and no identity: add one and the queue
# drains faster, remove one and its claim lapses. That is the property the hash
# sharding cannot provide.
#
# Environment:
#   MESOS_ROLE, CUR_CONTAINER, ALIBOT_CONFIG_SUFFIX   which pool to serve
#   GITHUB_TOKEN                                       (or via $ROUND_SETUP)
#   ROUND_SETUP    optional file SOURCED at the start of every round. Sourced,
#                  not run, so it can export credentials into this shell --
#                  which is the point: a gate token from a credential broker
#                  expires, and re-execing would carry a stale one forever.
#   IDLE_SLEEP     seconds to wait after a round that built nothing (300)

# The same identity continuous-builder.sh sets, for the same reason: the build
# MERGES the PR into the base branch, and git refuses to commit without one --
# "fatal: empty ident name". This lives in the entrypoint rather than in
# build-one.sh because it is per-worker setup, not per-PR.
#
# Left out of the first version of this script, which is what made the loop fail
# in setup on every round: the merge died before any compilation, so no build
# ever ran. Anything else continuous-builder.sh does once at startup belongs
# here too -- it is not a shared prologue, and nothing warns when it diverges.

# The claim key must be globally unique for a piece of work, and *.env names

# What this worker has already built, as "$check|$sha" lines.
#
# The loop's only other notion of "done" is the GitHub status the build posts,
# which the lister then sees and stops offering. That breaks down whenever the
# status does not get written -- SILENT mode during a bring-up, or a failing
# report-pr-errors -- and the failure mode is a LIVELOCK, not a slowdown: the
# just-built PR is still untested, still sorts first, and gets rebuilt forever
# while the rest of the queue starves. Observed on slc10: 11 builds of one PR
# in five minutes.
#
# The sharded loop never needed this because random.sample() picked a different
# PR each round, so a missing status cost one wasted rebuild rather than all of
# them. Walking an ordered list is what turns it fatal, and claiming is what
# makes the list ordered.
#
# Keyed by commit, so a new push is a new key and gets built. The cost is that
# one worker will not rebuild an identical (check, sha) twice in a session,
# which production does at random to catch flaky failures -- worth losing, since
# it only delays a retry until this allocation restarts, whereas a livelock
# stops the queue outright.
